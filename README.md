AnteUp

AnteUp is a low stakes, peer to peer blockchain solution for small bets of all kinds.  Sports, tv shows, and more are all provided for users to bet against each other.  The system is entirely run peer to peer, which allows for it to remove much of "Vegas Odds" of the betting, giving the community the power to decide how the odds will turn out.

Technologies used in the development of AnteUp include: BootStrap, NodeJS, Facebook Login API, TamperMonkey, Azure Blockchain, CSS, HTML and Javascript, but only the front end is hosted on Github.


AnteUp is a project developed in under 36 hours for LA Hacks 2019, created by Eric Ke, Jacob Azriel, Nadeem Khan, Nathan Zhao, and Ryan Welage.
